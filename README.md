# Advent of Code 2025 — aoc2025

Scaffold for solving Advent of Code 2025 in TypeScript + Node.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd /Users/todd/projects/aoc2025
npm install
```

2. Run a script (example):

```bash
npm run start
# or
npm run dev
```

Debugging in VS Code

- Open this folder in VS Code.
- Ensure dependencies are installed.
- Set breakpoints in `.ts` files and use the "Debug TypeScript (node)" launch configuration in the Run/Debug panel.

Notes

- This project uses the built-in Node 24 runtime to run TypeScript files directly (no `tsx`).
- `tsconfig.json` is configured for ESM using `nodenext` module resolution.
